# Procedures for Computing Bolometric Corrections
I've always been very interested in astronomy, especially speculating on the conditions and properties of extrasolar planets. One particularly important property to take into account when inferring characteristics such as a planet's equilibrium temperature or the inner and outer radii of a solar system's habitable zone is a star's _bolometric_ magnitude, which more effectively represents its total energy output across the _entire_ spectrum, rather than merely visible light. This is especially important for dim stars such as M and late K-type dwarfs that emit far more of their energy in the infrared spectrum, or brighter A, B and O-type stars that skew toward the ultraviolet.

A star's bolometric magnitude is derived from its absolute visual magnitude by applying a _bolometric correction_. The values of these corrections can often be found in pre-computed tables around the internet and in various publications, however they aren't always comprehensive. Luckily, there are published methods of computing them that can be easily implemented on nearly any computer.

This directory contains various implementations of a function/procedure for computing BCV values given a star's temperature in Kelvin, based on a method presented by Phillip Flower in 1996 with corrections for misprinted coefficients provided by Guillermo Torres in 2010.

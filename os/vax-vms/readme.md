VAX/VMS operating system 
------------------------

**VAX/VMS** - the VAX Virtual Memory System, was the primary operating system
used on the legendary VAX family of minicomputers produced by Digital Equipment
Corporation from the late 1970s through the late 1990s, and also available on
later Alpha, Itanium and now x86 systems.

This loosely organized collection of working notes serves as a guide to
installing and using VAX/VMS from a novice perspective. Some things in these
notes may not be considered best practice, but might hopefully prove helpful
for getting a VAX into a functional state.

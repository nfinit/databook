VAX/VMS operating system 
------------------------

**VAX/VMS** - the VAX Virtual Memory System, was the primary operating system
used on the legendary VAX family of minicomputers produced by Digital Equipment
Corporation from the late 1970s through the late 1990s, also available on later 
Alpha, Itanium and now x86 systems. Though VMS is a marginal system today, it
was nonetheless hugely influential on modern computing, especially Windows NT,
and today presents a familiar yet deeply alien environment to challenge
hobbyists and professionals alike.

This loosely organized collection of working notes on running VMS systems is
written from a completely novice perspective for personal use and may not
always reflect best practices. Nonetheless, it is hopeful that these notes
might be of use to other novice users starting out in the rather imposing
VAX ecosystem.

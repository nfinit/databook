VAX/VMS guides
--------------

This is a loosely organized collection of working notes serving as a
*non-authoritative* guide to installing, administrating and using the VMS
operating system and various applications on VAX systems from a novice
perspective. Some information presented on these pages might not reflect
best practices, but they will hopefully prove useful to getting your VAX
into a functional state.
